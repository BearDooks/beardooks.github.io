Welcome to Chucklindblom.com

A site to get general Tech News, Reviews, and General Hoop-La about nothing in particular. On here you will find scripts I write to make life easy, thoughts on events, and projects I am working on.

I try to keep this site updated as best I can but I find during the week I don’t have time, or don’t feel the urge to write, but that should all be changing soon. I would like to start weekly posts, about anything to start, and then move on from there. So stay tuned.
