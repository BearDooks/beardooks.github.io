# Just A Small Update

I have been working on the game, but not by much. Coming having PAX East 2019 come and go really put a hinder int he amount of time I had to write some code. I did however get some great feedback from some of the developers that I talk to on a regular basis. Changing the game from a 3D render to a 2D top down was the best choice in the end. I have been able to get a working prototype going at a much faster pace, and it is giving me the knoweldge I need to start a 3D version later.

# Current Plans

Since this is a small update I am changing the format up a bit, again not like anyone reads this. I am going to try to get a few hours into it this week but I am not sure. I am still fighting the whole 'play games with your friends thing' instead of sitting down and working.

I did however get a small feature in for Judd that I am working on. A particle emitter for fire and smoke on the car when there is a crash. I need to fix it not spinning all the time when the vehicle turns. That issue has to do with the car spinning and the emitter being a child of it.
